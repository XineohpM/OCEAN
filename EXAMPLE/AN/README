The Ammonium Nitrate example shows the effects of the core-level shift.
By default the input will carry out a core-level shift calculation, such that 
the average shift (between the NH4 and NO3 nitrogen atoms) is zero. 

The emission is polarization dependent. The script avg.csh will make an 
average over the nitrogen sites as well as x, y, and z and save this to 
CNBSE/xes.avg
