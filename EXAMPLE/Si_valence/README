Valence calculation of Si.

The legacy ai2nbse results are included. 
Note that there are differences in the spectra (ai2nbse v. ocean), these are 
due to slight differences in the the conversion between units as well as 
significant rounding errors in the density which in turn changes the ladder/
direct interaction strength.

We are using bulk silicon. The psp is probably not very good; DO NOT USE IT.
