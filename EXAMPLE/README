Each directory contains an example and a copy of the expected spectra. 

Note, you will need to adjust the input file by changing: dft, para_prefix, 
and pp_list (when present). This is because you can run with either ABINIT 
or QuantumESPRESSO (depending on what is installed) and the pseudopotentials 
must be either fhi or psp8 for ABINIT and upf for QuantumESPRESSO. In addition, 
the para_prefix is machine specific. 

The perl scripts in the top level are currently not functional
