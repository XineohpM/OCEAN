This is a copy of the standard LiF example.

We have replaced with FHI-style psp with ones from PseduoPojo (v0.4).
The oncvpsp input files have been modified so that the psp format is UPF. 

This example shows how the pseudo database can be used to automicatically load the ONCV psps from PseudoDojo
