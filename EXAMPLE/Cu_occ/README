This shows the OCEAN functionality for changing the occupation numbers in the core-level BSE.

The standard way of running the core-level BSE is that the occupation numbers 
follow from a T=0 Fermi function (0 or 1). 

Currently, two other options are available. You can use a T>0 Fermi function (fermi) or 
a uniform (fixed) value.
