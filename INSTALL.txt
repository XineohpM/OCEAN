You will need to set up Makefile.arch to match your system. 
Please see the annotated Makefile.arch.example for help.

To run you will need either ABINIT or QuantumEspresso (or both)
Optionally you can make use of the FFTW library (fftw.org).


After setting up Makefile.arch you will be able to make and then make install.

In the EXAMPLES directory are several quick examples and a sample output 
to check that your install has completed correctly.
