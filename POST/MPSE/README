This is a postprocessing step for after a valence (optical/UV) calculations. 

After a successful OCEAN calculation, go in to the CNBSE directory (where the 
opcons file is located). The MPSE can then be run using the mpse.pl script. It 
will automatically use 50 poles and iterate 3 times. More flexibility may be 
added in future releases. The MPSE-modified optical data are broken out into 
individual files eps1_SE, eps2_SE, inds_SE, refl_SE, loss_SE, and opcons_SE.
